Only for notes If they have some codes running along the roads

Final task

Sharp your task
For a final task
Look around, stand still.

Take your heart for any luck.
But if you’ve met a nasty bug
You will have to kill.

It will cause no terror
It would be the common error
Just put down missing comma.

Built your own array
Keep on faith. Never betray.
Be discreet. Не будь ты Фомой.

Follow the setting sun.
You should overcome
Through all kind of ruin

All the bugs will have been caught.
You know they could be a lot.
Just keep on doing.

Unleash your trusty dogs.
Call them out from all the docks.
They would serve you with debugging.

They’ll bite all the wrong souls.
They’ll clean off the Git’s console.
It will make good for cod’s running.
